        <h3>1. Permitting</h3>
        <p>The first step is obtaining a swimming pool permit to begin construction. Permits are governed and issued by the city in which you live. We’ll secure an official permit for you.</p>

        <h3>2. Layout and Excavation</h3>
        <p>The shape and position of your swimming pool will be discussed long before excavation begins. Excavation begins when all parties involved agree on placement.</p>

        <h3>3. Steel, Concrete, and Electrical Work</h3>
        <p>Setting the wall panels and braces brings the project to life. This portion of the project moves fast! Within a few hours, you can see the shape and the new grade of your yard. A concrete locking collar is poured around the perimeter to strengthen the structure and make it one. While the panels are going up, trenches are being excavated from the filter location to the house. Electrical conduit is placed in the trenches, and bonding is done poolside to meet requirements. Most towns require inspections at this point in the project.</p>

        <h3>4. Plumbing and Backfill</h3>
        <p>Installation of all plumbing lines takes place just before we start to backfill the swimming pool. Taking the time to ask about any additional or future needs has already taken place. We use 1 1/2″ black polyethylene pipe that can withstand pressures up to 100 PSI with a longer life expectancy compared to PVC or other flexible pipes on the market. Each line is hand-covered with sand to ensure there are no punctures on the lines. The dirt is carefully moved back around the swimming pool in layers for compaction.</p>

        <h3>5. Concrete, Liner, and Water</h3>
        <p>After the coping is installed, a second concrete truck pulls up to deposit the concrete used for the base under the swimming pool liner. This process is one of the most important because the swimming pool liner will come in direct contact with this surface. Our construction team looks forward to this day to show off their abilities to trowel. After troweling, you are only a few short minutes from the ice-cold water being delivered.</p>

        <h3>6. Filtration, Startup, and Swimming Pool School</h3>
        <p>Once the system is installed and running correctly, Superior Pool Service will schedule a time with you to learn about all the components involved – your very own Pool School session!</p>

        <h3>7. Fence & Decking</h3>
        <p>During the initial consultation, a budget will be discussed regarding your fence and deck needs. All in-ground swimming pools need a barrier. There are different options when choosing deck composition. These options vary in price and look; they will be explained in detail for a solid decision. These portions are subbed out with recommendations by Superior Pool Service.</p>
